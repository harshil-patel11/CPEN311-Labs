# Basic-Tone-Organ

[This was done as a lab for CPEN 311 - Digital Systems Design]

## Main Components:

- Built and tested a clock divider module that allows us to divide the time period of a reference clock signal (clock_divider.sv, clock_divider_tb.sv)
- Completed and tested a LED control module that turns on LEDs from left to right on the DE1-SOC (led_control.sv, led_control_tb.sv)
- Added code for an oscilloscope output in SignalTap (part of Quartus).

## Additional Info:

- Verilog code, testbenches and Quartus output files including .sof, .qpf files can be found in the /rtl folder
- Files related to simulations can be found in the /sim folder
- Any additional screenshots can be found in the /doc folder
- A README.pdf can also be found in the root directory that contains results and explanations of simulations/SignalTap outputs
